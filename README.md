[2016-05-16] Challenge #267 [Easy] All the places your dog didn't win -   submitted 5 days ago by Blackshell2 0 Description  Your dog just won X place in a dog show, congratulations! You post your star's photo and placement announcement to /r/aww and, predictably, a funny redditor asks what places the rest of the participating dogs took. Your job is to create a program that lists all places within the range of 0-100 in spoken English, excluding the placing (X) of your winning pup.
